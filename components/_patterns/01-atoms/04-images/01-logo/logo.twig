 * - logo_link_base_class - the base class name. Defaults to 'logo'
 * - logo_image_modifiers - array of modifiers to add to the base classname of the logo
 * - logo_url - default is '/' to link to the homepage
 *   this is overridden in the logo.yml file to show (only in Pattern Lab) that overrides do work
 *   delete the logo_url definition from logo.yml to see the default take effect
